## Welcome to Global Health Grid #

I am working on an e-health application based on geographic information (GIS) and cloud storage. Currently e-health is a hot topic worldwide with a huge amount of information on the WHO website and our DOH website. However there doesn't seem to be much progress.

My idea takes advantage of low cost current technology.

Microsoft Azure will be used to store and process data and healthcare providers will be given a simple application to upload data and download information. It should be possible to use smart phones and mobile devices. There won't be need for expensive infrastructure for servers and databases or technical support. Azure takes care of hardware, data backup and security at virtually no cost*.

Here is a early preview of the healthcare providers can expect. These are screen shots of a test application for Windows. 

There are three screens:

1. Startup: View of current epidemiology and Login.
2. E-Health: Access to patient clinical records.
3. Epidemiology: Record and send a short daily summary of conditions treated.

Important features:

1. Epidemiology statistics. All healthcare providers will have access to statistics for their region and the country.
2. E-Health will records patients alerts and chronic medication, clinical notes, referrals, prescriptions and telemedicine and referrals. It will implement 'actionable data' triggers for population health management automation including automatic SMS reminders and communication to patients. 
3. Ability to use the device camera to scan and record handwritten notes.
4. Cloud storage is incredibly cheap (5 cents per gigabyte per month)
