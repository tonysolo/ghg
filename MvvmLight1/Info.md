# Global Health Grid - what it does #

In general this application simplifies recording healthcare data as well as organising it in a form that can be used for e-health and for epidemiology and population health management.

The application could help manage healthcare in any country problems including poor countries. The method uses a geographic information system (GIS) to divide the country into manageable size regions to keep track of epidemiology and healthcare and plan providers and facilities. 

My system, for example, would divide South Africa into 200 GIS regions of 80 X 80 km each. This is still a large area but limits to number of people from millions to thousands and simplifies allocating unique patient IDs, planning and using IT more efficiently with distributed data.

Each GIS region would have a Cloud based health information exchange (HIE) for storing the patients' e-health records. The HIE would support the idea of population health management (PHM) and 'actionable data'.

 Actionable data means that patients' records will include ways to 'flag' situations for periodic automatic processing, for example to track missed antenatal visits of incomplete vaccinations history and notify patients or community workers to act and resolve the problem.

This will be an advanced system to streamline treatments and to collect epidemiology data. It will be achievable at low cost. It will replace static paper records with dynamic e-health records. It will provide statistics and enable telemedicine and community workers to improve healthcare and reduce costs. It will help manage and eliminate epidemics such as HIV and TB and maternal and child mortality,
