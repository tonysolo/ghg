e-health can revolutionise healthcare and provide solutions for epidemics such as HIV and TB.

The e-health system I describe is intended for population health management which means identifying 
ways that help people look after their health and use healthcare resources in a sustainable cost effective 
way. The idea is to use information technology to monitor and communicate with patients and healtcare providers 
using ways to continually track of patients and providers, healthcare visits, epidemiology, statistics and costs.

The planned e-health software will use Cloud computing and organise work by dividing the population according to 
geographic region using GIS to name the regions and allocate patients and providers.

The central design feature of the software is the ability to support 'actionable' patient data. This means the
ability to track risks such as missed appointments or vaccinations and trigger actions such as sending an 
sms warning to the patient and simultaneously recording the statistics. There are unlimited applications for this 
technology which could for example impact management of HIV and TB by organising telemedicine, community health visits
and recording statistics. 

This means using technology to efficiently deal with the background repetitive tasks and freeing providers to do their 
clinical work with proper information technology and planning.

Cloud computing is ideal for the application and the cost is negligible.

 

The ideal system would monitor epidemiology, 
record individual patients healthcare status and all heathcare encounters, 
including outpaients and inpatient treatments, 
medication and prescriptions and referrals and telemedicine and 
support population health management though triggers and alerts originating from ehealth data.

Presently e-health systems are limited, poorly designed and many have failed in other countries.

I believe that the problem for e-health is the scale of healthcare. There are billions of people
and they all seek healthcare on average twice a year. For South Africa's population that's 100 million 
visits a year. No database can handle that, particularly if data includes huge such as X-rays.

A practical solution is to use Cloud data storage to provide the required scale. 
The solution I describe uses GIS methods to distribute storage and processing and focuses on 'actionable' 
data processing methods for population health management that will help monitor and control epidemics 
such as HIV, TB and maternal and child mortality.

The solution uses Microsoft Azure Cloud storage. Blob storage containers are individually named for each GIS region as descbed below and added to an Azure Storage account owned by the country enclosing
